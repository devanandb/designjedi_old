Design can transform experiences and markets. UX leaders can and need to find big <span>business problems</span> and define innovative ways to solve them, leveraging <span>design thinking</span>. The question is, how do you get there? Not by following the traditional path. Let’s take a look at how great leaders of design and UX achieve <span>results</span>, not talk.</p>

Just look around– great design has <span>disrupted markets</span> everywhere, from consumer electronic equipment and gadgets we carry with us, to our cars, our apparel, and the sites and applications we access every day. But “Cool” isn’t just about visual appeal. It is about serving a purpose, about solving a problem. The best designs do both: They <span>monetize</span> well, and they <span>engage</span>!</p>

But, that didn’t get in the way of <span>swimming</span>, <span>running</span>, <span>riding</span>, <span>hiking</span>, <span>reading</span>, <span>learning</span>, and <span>loving my family</span>! Near the end of 2013, after presenting at an event in <span>Barcelona</span>, I even had the fortune to meet up with my daughter in <span>Paris</span> after her studies in <span>Brussels</span>, and travel to Frankfurt, where we flew back to the US together.</p>
